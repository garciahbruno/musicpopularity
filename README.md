Song Popularity Analysis with Pandas

This project aims to explore whether a song's popularity can be predicted based on various musical attributes such as liveliness, tempo, energy, and more. By leveraging the power of the Pandas library, we analyze and visualize the relationships between these factors and a song's popularity.
Project Overview

In the modern music industry, predicting a song's success is a challenging task due to the multitude of factors that can influence its popularity. This project uses data analysis techniques to investigate whether specific musical characteristics can provide insights into what makes a song popular.
Key Features

    Data Collection: Gathered data on various musical attributes (e.g., liveliness, tempo, energy) from a dataset of songs.

    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, normalizing data, and more.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers within the data using Pandas.

    Visualization: Created visualizations to illustrate the relationships between musical attributes and song popularity.

    Statistical Analysis: Conducted statistical tests and regression analysis to evaluate the significance of each attribute in predicting popularity.

Technologies Used

    Python: The core programming language used for the project.
    Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
    Matplotlib/Seaborn: Used for data visualization and creating insightful plots.
    NumPy: Employed for numerical operations and statistical analysis.

Results and Findings

The analysis revealed several interesting trends and correlations between the musical attributes and a song's popularity. Some key findings include:
